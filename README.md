# Plot-SkyTEM
plot USGS SkyTEM csv results from Yellowstone 2016

These scripts plot SkyTEM results from the Bedrosian et al., 2021 dataset (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9LVAU7W). Download the CSVs from that
dataset first. Then set the path in the plot_ynp_tem script to reference the appropriate CSV. Select a point of interest using UTM 
coordinates. Define a line to extract and plot using the KML provided.

Work in progress. No responsiblity for errors or improper performance.
